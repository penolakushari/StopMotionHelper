Boiling Pot branch
==================
It was kind of meant to be a melting pot, but whatever.
This is the testing branch I use where I merge all the branches before putting them on main SMH github.

Stop Motion Helper
==================
Stop Motion Helper is a tool for Garry's Mod designed to make stop motion animation easier and more manageable.
It can also be used for recorded animation, but it is mainly designed around stop motion.

If you have any bug fixes or improvements you have made, feel free to make a pull request. However, before you do, please make sure your code works, is clean and clear (identation, variable names that are understandable, and comments for not-so-understandable parts) and uses reactive paradigm like the rest of the addon.
